# Date Calculator

The **Date Calculator** is a Python program that allows users to input a day of the year and a year, and it calculates the corresponding date, week of the year, and whether it's a leap year.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. No additional libraries are required; the program uses the built-in `datetime` module.

## Usage

1. Run the `date_calculator.py` script.
2. Enter the day of the year (1 to 365 or 366 for leap years) and the desired year.
3. Click the "Calculate" button.
4. The program will display the calculated date, week of the year, and leap year status.

## Example

```
$ python date_calculator.py
Day of Year: 150
Year: 2024
Date: 29-05-2024
Week of the year: 22
Leap Year: True
```
